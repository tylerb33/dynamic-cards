# Dynamic Cards - NSS Exercise

## Requirements

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM that includes it's own delete button. You decide the height/width of the card.
1. When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually [removed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild) from the DOM.
